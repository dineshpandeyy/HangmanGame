# Journey: Hangman 

# Motivation
 When I was in high school, I used to play guessing the character of words with my friends: not on the computer but on paper. It was cool!I had idea of building using programming language. Final project for CSCI100 was a golden opportunity to build my intented game.

 # Challenge
 There were lots of Challenge ,and I struggled a lot throughout my Journey. This was my first personal project, so I believed to struggle was normal. At first, I built a command line game without creating function. I did it quite easily, but it was difficult for me to put all those code in the function. I struggled, found a way on my own and learnt many new things. 

 # What Next
 I realized that project is the best way to nourish the concept learn. In coming winter vacation, I'll working on providing hint in a randomly generated word.
